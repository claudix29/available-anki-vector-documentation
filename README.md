# All of the documentation related to Anki Vector available.
The purpose of this repository is to bring together in a single place all the available documentation regarding Anki Vector, its history, its hardware, and its software.

DISCLAIMER: Part of the documentation might be outdated. It's still pretty useful though.

## [DDL Support Documentation](https://github.com/bussardrobbie/ddl-docs)

This repository was, at the time, a last-ditch effort to provide documentation for the community while Digital Dream Labs was on the absolute brink of bankruptcy and their operations were at risk. While DDL still maintains an [online copy of this support documentation](https://support.digitaldreamlabs.com), at the time of writing DDL appears to be operating with a skeleton crew and the online docs do not appear to be updated frequently or accurately. The repository here can be utilized by the community to build a knowledge base that is more up-to-date and accurate, if they wish, using these as a base.
