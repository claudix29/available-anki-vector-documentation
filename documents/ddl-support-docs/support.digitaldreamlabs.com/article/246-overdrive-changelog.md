-   This is an iOS-only release.

-   Eliminates a bug that would cause some vehicles to get lost on the
    track and start driving the wrong direction.

## [2018-01-10 ]{.s1}[**What\'s new in Version 3.2.0?**]{.s1} {#whats-new-in-version-3.2.0 .p1}

-   Introducing Razorback, a powerful shotgun that shreds though your

## [2017-12-04 ]{.s1}[**What\'s new in Version 3.1.0?**]{.s1} {#whats-new-in-version-3.1.0 .p1}

-   Play ahead of the curve. It\'s now easier than ever to change lanes
    with your car.
-   Exciting new game balance improvements. Here\'s what\'s new:
    -   Game mode
        -   Weapon and Support Item now unlock earlier in the campaign.
-   What makes OVERDRIVE the world\'s most intelligent battle racing
    system? Tech so advanced, it feels like the future.
-   Rate the OVERDRIVE app now.
-   Gamepad updates.
-   Performance improvements.
-   Bug fixes and polish, including the following:
    -   Adds improvements to Anki\'s Account implementation that should
        help to improve the reliability of playing OVERDRIVE with the
        same Anki Account on multiple devices.
    -   Supertrucks are now excluded from the Campaign Matches 1, 3, 5.
        This is because these matches are designed to teach new players
        how to use Throttle, Steering, Weapons, and Support Items.
        Supertrucks use these items differently than Supercars, so these
        guides do not work well with Supertrucks.
    -   Improved Android vehicle discovery when a player selects a
        Vehicle or assigns one to a Commander.
    -   Starting iOS Multiplayer Games should now be more reliable. In
        general, how you set up Multiple Games has also been improved
        for Android and iOS devices.
    -   The "!" icon that appears on the Main screen\'s \"hamburger\"
        menu is now disappear after visiting the OVERDRIVE in-app store.
    -   Max Speed Boosts were originally removed from the Coin Shop, but
        the slots still existed in Vehicle Upgrades. They now have also
        been removed from the Garage. Sorry for any confusion this
        caused.
    -   It\'s now easier to tell the difference between enabled and
        disabled Upgrades in the vehicles\' Upgrades tab.
    -   Supercars and Supertrucks should now more consistently line up
        at the Start/Finish line - not stop short or go past it.
    -   The daily Goal of defeating Vice is now possible to earn.
    -   Should no longer see duplicated Skull or Nuke upgrade items in
        the Coin Shop.

        -   Bronze, Silver, and Gold
        -   Defeat each Commander to unlock more challenging missions
    -   Supertruck owners can put any Commander behind the wheel, adding
        a new dimension to Suptertruck battles.
    -   Steering has been tuned to help you change lanes, and a
        refreshed throttle system provides more control of your
        Supercar\'s speed as you race around the track.
-   Fixes some situations where Track Scanning would fail to complete
    and iOS Multiplayer games would fail to start.
