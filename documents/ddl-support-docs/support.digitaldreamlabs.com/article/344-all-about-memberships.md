    it?](//support.digitaldreamlabs.com/article/338-how-do-i-find-vectors-serial-number){target="_blank"}
6.  You will be securely redirected to Stripe to enter payment details.
7.  Once your transaction is complete, you\'ll be directed back to
    Stratus! It will take a few seconds to create your new Membership.
    Once it is created:
    1.  **It may take up to 24 hours for your Vector robot to become
        responsive to voice commands.**
        1.  If you have recently purchased your Vector, you can bypass
            this period by performing a [Clear User Data
            reset](//support.digitaldreamlabs.com/article/384-performing-a-clear-user-data-reset).
    2.  **Firmware updates will be distributed generally within 48-72
        hours.**
    3.  If your subscription does not activate within 24 hours, please
        email us at support@digitaldreamlabs.com.

firmware updates to be distributed to your robot after your subscription
begins. After 24 hours have elapsed, if you are still not receiving
service then please Contact Us at support@digitaldreamlabs.com.

Billing will reoccur automatically. Annual customers will be notified
via email of upcoming charges 72 hours in advance; all customers will
receive receipts of charges once processed.
