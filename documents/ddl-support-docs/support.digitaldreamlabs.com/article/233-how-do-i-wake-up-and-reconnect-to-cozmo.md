# How do I wake up and reconnect to Cozmo? {#how-do-i-wake-up-and-reconnect-to-cozmo .title}

[](javascript:window.print() "Print this article"){.printArticle
aria-label="Print this Article"}

Since just like everyone else, Cozmo needs his rest and a chance to
recharge.  But how do you wake him up and get him playing again?

When Cozmo runs out of battery and needs a charge, or it\'s time for him
to take a nape while his friends are sleeping, what does it take to wake
him up again?  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: sections
## [Cozmo requires his Charger to wake up]{.wysiwyg-font-size-large}

Without his Charger, you cannot turn Cozmo On and his WiFi Network will
not start broadcasting. Once you use Cozmo\'s Charger to turn him On,
you can then connect to his WiFi Network and use his app to wake him
up.

::: sections
## [How to use Cozmo\'s Charger]{.wysiwyg-font-size-large}

1.  Connect Cozmo\'s Charger to a power source
2.  Place Cozmo on his charging cradle

-   His Green backpack lights will come on and start pulsing, indicating
    that he is charging

At this point, you can select Cozmo\'s WiFi network from your device\'s
WiFi settings, launch the Cozmo app, and press the Connect button to
wake Cozmo.

If Cozmo is already on his Charger, his Charger is plugged in to a power
source, but his backpack lights are off, you need to turn Cozmo On
before you can connect to him. Do the following: 

1.  Lift Cozmo off of his Charger
2.  Place Cozmo back on his Charger

-   His Green backpack lights will come on

At this point, you can select Cozmo\'s WiFi network from your device\'s
WiFi settings, launch the Cozmo app, and press the Connect button to
wake Cozmo.

::: sections
## [You don\'t have to leave Cozmo on his Charger once you turn him On]{.wysiwyg-font-size-large}

Actually, once you have turned Cozmo On by placing him on his Charger,
you can move him anywhere and then connect to him. This is possible just
as long as his backpack lights are White. If you wait more than 30
minutes to connect to Cozmo, he will turn off and you will have to place
him back on his Charger to turn him back on.

## [Some Additional Notes]{.wysiwyg-font-size-large}

Once your device has connected to Cozmo\'s WiFi Network, you never have
to re-enter his WiFi password.

If you have an Android device and you have previously connected to
Cozmo, there is no need to manually select his WiFi Network. The Android
version of the Cozmo app will automatically reconnect to Cozmo\'s WiFi
network if it is available when you launch the Cozmo app and click the
Connect button.

Manually selecting Cozmo\'s WiFi network from within the iOS
WiFi Settings is required if you have any other saved WiFi Networks in
your iOS device.
