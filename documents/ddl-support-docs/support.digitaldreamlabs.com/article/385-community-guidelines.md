# Community Guidelines {#community-guidelines .title}

[](javascript:window.print() "Print this article"){.printArticle
aria-label="Print this Article"}

The Digital Dream Labs (DDL) community is shaped by our users, fans and
DDL employees. We want all of our community members to have a safe place
to showcase their creative self-expression through our products and
services. Any behavior that prevents users from having this experience
will be subject to review by the DDL team and may result in termination.
The following are a list of guidelines for our community. While this
list is not exhaustive, it is meant to serve as a guidepost for conduct
while interacting with DDL's ecosystem:

-   Treat everyone with respect. Healthy debates are natural, but
    kindness is required.
-   Harassment of any kind is unacceptable.
-   Hate speech, bullying, or abuse of any member of DDL's community or
    team will not be tolerated.
-   Trolling members of the community or DDL staff is unacceptable and
    will be subject to action from the DDL team including but not
    limited to termination. 
-   Any activity deemed to be illegal including but not limited to
    organized crime, hate groups or terrorism is subject to immediate
    termination.
-   The use of spam such as unwanted emailing, communication or
    solicitation is prohibited as part of DDL's community.
-   Explicit violence in language, visual imagery, or by implication is
    not permitted. 

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Violation Review Process {#violation-review-process children-count="0"}

In the event that a community member violates DDL's community
guidelines, DDL will take the following actions to respond to the
violation(s).  

### First Time and / or Minor Violations: Warning {#first-time-and-or-minor-violations-warning children-count="0"}

When any behavior occurs that goes against DDL's community guidelines,
DDL will intervene to remove the offending content and notify any
participating members of the violation. First time offenses and minor
violations will be met with a warning. Continued infringement of these
community guidelines may result in a termination of the participating
parties' relationship with DDL.

### Repeated and / or Severe Violations: Termination {#repeated-and-or-severe-violations-termination children-count="0"}

DDL reserves the right to permanently terminate its relationship with
community members as a result of persistent and / or egregious
violations of our community guidelines or other behavior determined to
negatively impact other community members and / or DDL employees. Under
this termination the user forfeits access to DDL products, services,
content and support. In response to persistent and / or egregious
violations, the process for formal termination will follow these steps:

1.  DDL will notify the customer in writing of our intention to
    terminate the relationship and will take steps to limit their access
    to all communities managed or maintained by the company. (This
    includes but is not limited to the user's access to DDL support,
    email notifications and the ability to interact with DDL or its
    employees on various online platforms.)
2.  Following notification, the community member will be allowed 15
    business days to appeal the decision to the company.
3.  Within 15 business days, DDL will issue reimbursement for a prorated
    portion of any outstanding purchases. (Examples of such purchases
    include subscription packages and any unfulfilled or undelivered
    orders of physical goods, subject to the Digital Dream Labs [Refund
    Policy](https://www.digitaldreamlabs.com/policies/refund-policy).)
