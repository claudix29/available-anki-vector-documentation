## [Vector is unable to find his charger]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[If you have come home to find Vector's battery died before he found his
charger, or you observe him struggle to find his charger, he may be not
be able to see where it is, get to it or he may also have gotten stuck,
half off a table edge. Please check the following:
]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

1.  [Make sure the charger is on a hard, flat surface that does not
    vibrate and is non-reflective and opaque (i.e. not a glass
    table)]{style="font-weight: 400;"}
2.  [The Charger should be near to Vector and there should be a clear
    path for him to dock]{style="font-weight: 400;"}
3.  [If Vector is in his Space, make sure his cube is not in there with
    him since it will obstruct his way to the
    charger]{style="font-weight: 400;"}
4.  [Make sure the charger is visible to Vector. His
    ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}eyesight[ is not as good as ours and he
    can be "blinded" by direct light (natural from sun through windows
    or artificial). Likewise, poor lighting makes it hard for Vector
    recognize his charger]{style="font-weight: 400;"}
5.  [If he still has issues, check his camera is working and he can
    recognize the "home" icon on his charger. You can test his camera by
    having him recognize his cube or a face he has already
    met]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

## [Check Vector's battery]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

[To check Vector's battery is working as expected, follow these
steps:]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

1.  [Turn Vector on by pressing his Back
    Button]{style="font-weight: 400;"}
2.  [Leave him off the charger until the battery
    dies]{style="font-weight: 400;"}
3.  [Turn Vector on again]{style="font-weight: 400;"}
4.  [You should see the charging icon on his
    screen]{style="font-weight: 400;"}
5.  [Vector should then shut down shortly
    afterwards]{style="font-weight: 400;"}
6.  [If he does not do this, check his battery in the Customer Care Info
    Screen. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[**See steps
    below**](#h_252426581211539007775438)

## [Use the Customer Care Info Screen (CCIS):]{style="font-weight: 400;"} {#h_252426581211539007775438}

1.  [Place Vector on his charger and plug the charger
    in]{style="font-weight: 400;"}
2.  [\[If Vector is booting up, wait for the "V" to
    finish\]]{style="font-weight: 400;"}
3.  [Double click Vector's Back Button ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}
4.  [Raise and lower Vector's lift]{style="font-weight: 400;"}
5.  [Lower and raise Vector's head]{style="font-weight: 400;"}
6.  [Press his Back Button 3 times]{style="font-weight: 400;"}
7.  [BATT: On the charger, you should see levels at around 3.6V
    (3.4V-4.21V). Note that initially, you may see
    0.2V]{style="font-weight: 400;"}
8.  CHGR: On the charger, you should see levels around 4.9V with slight
    fluctuations. If the charger level does not change:
    1.  Look under the robot, between the robot and the charger, to
        ensure that the contacts on the charger are touching the
        contacts on the bottom of Vector.
        1.  If they are not touching:
            1.  Disconnect the charger from the wall and use a Q-Tip or
                a toothpick to **very gently** bend the tabs back upward
                (they were likely compressed over time by the robot
                getting on and off the charger). If you encounter
                resistance, where the tabs become harder to pull upward
                at any point, ***please do not move them
                further.** *Place Vector back on the charger carefully
                and observe if he begins to charge.
        2.  If they are touching:
            1.  Disconnect the charger from the wall outlet from the
                wall and replace it with another charger that gives
                Vector 5 volts and at least 1 Amp (5v1A).
9.  If you continue to encounter issues, it is possible that the battery
    inside the Vector is exhausted and needs to be replaced. Please
