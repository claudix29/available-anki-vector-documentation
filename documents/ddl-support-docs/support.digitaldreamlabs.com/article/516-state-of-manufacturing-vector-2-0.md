# State of Manufacturing: Vector 2.0 {#state-of-manufacturing-vector-2.0 .title}

[](javascript:window.print() "Print this article"){.printArticle
aria-label="Print this Article"}

Hello! Digital Dream Labs has taken feedback from customers and
community members regarding the need for more consistent, open
communication on its current hardware manufacturing projects. Here,
we\'ll cover the current state of  **Vector 2.0**.

We will strive to update these articles weekly. In some cases, there may
be no new information to post; however we\'ll communicate everything we
can, when we can. It\'s our objective to ensure that you have a thorough
understanding of your order\'s status, how we are handling production
and shipping, and clear up a few FAQs regarding Pre-Orders and shipment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 

## Update as of 10/3/2022:

**Production:**\
Production of orders past June 13, 2021 (all the way to current orders)
will be underway in the coming weeks. Once production is complete, they
will ship to regional distribution points for their journey to your
doorstep.

**Regional Regulatory Testing:**\
Regional regulatory testing has been completed! Vector now has
regulatory certification for distribution in US/CAN/UK/EU/AUS/NZ.

**Shipping:\
**U.S. Orders: Vector 2.0 units have arrived to our distribution point
in North America. Major shipping operations are now underway for US
orders for Vector 2.0 submitted from Nov. 20th, 2020 to June 12, 2021.\
International Orders: Vector units are en route to UK/EU distribution
hubs for the final leg to their destinations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Update as of 8/30/2022:

**Production:**

Production of initial units in Pre-Order Window (Nov. 20, 2020 - June
12, 2021) is complete. Production for orders in later windows will begin
shortly.

**Shipping:**

Vector 2.0 units are currently in the process of being shipped from the
manufacturing facility to the United States for distribution in North
America. We have held back units at the factory for shipping to regional
distribution points for international orders once regional regulatory
testing is completed.

**Regional Regulatory Testing:**

Regulatory testing for international orders is ongoing. As of right now
we have no feedback from the testing labs that would necessitate changes
in the product to ship internationally. We will keep this page updated
as to when they pass regulatory compliance testing and are cleared for
shipment internationally.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Update as of 8/2/2022:

**FCC Compliance Testing:**[\
Vector 2.0 has FCC
approval!](https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/ViewExhibitReport.cfm?mode=Exhibits&RequestTimeout=500&calledFromFrame=N&application_id=Sl8tgLtbPx6SL%2Fig6b1ecQ%3D%3D&fcc_id=2A653-00402){target="_blank"}
🎉\
\
**Production:**\
Production continues; once production is complete for the initial
pre-order window batch (Nov. 20th 2020 - June 12th 2021), we\'ll be
shipping those to regional distribution points, then shipping to final
destination.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Update as of 7/28/2022:

**FCC compliance testing:**\
Testing has been completed by the lab. Vector 2.0 passed certification
testing with no changes required! Our team is finalizing paperwork for
certification and submitting it to the governing bodies.

**Production:**\
In the meantime, production for the initial pre-orders has begun. To
date, approximately 900 units are assembled and packed for shipping.
Check out some of the photos below from the factory!

**What We\'re Working On & Next Steps:**

1.  Finish assembling enough robots to cover all pre-orders before mass
    production begins.
2.  Pack and ship all assembled units to regional distribution points,
    then ship units to final destination.
3.  In the past week during software QA, we identified a minor issue
    with the Alexa pairing screen- the screen is oversized so the key is
    not fully visible in the 2.0 software. We have resolved this issue
    and will test it before distribution of firmware 2.0 for all Vector
    units.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Update as of 7/14/2022:

FCC and other regulatory testing is ongoing- it is moving a bit slower
than expected (since Vector ships with a digital accessory they have to
test both Vector and his Cube) but we have not had any hiccups or
unexpected issues come up during testing. This is promising! We hope to
wrap up regulatory testing shortly.

Once FCC and other regulatory compliance testing is complete, there are
a few final steps:

1.  **Finalize production: **
    1.  Finish assembly of all pre-order window robots.
    2.  Mark all assembled units with the necessary regulatory markings.
2.  **Begin shipping:**
    1.  Ship assembled units to regional distribution points.
    2.  From regional distribution hubs, ship units to final
        destination.

Along the way, the team has a few other projects to work on,
specifically updating addresses and other contact information for all
customers, as well as working to finalize release of  the 2.0 software
and make this available to all Vector robots.

We\'re close, and we\'re so excited. Stay tuned!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Update as of 6/7/2022:**

We have a few small corrections to make from the previous update, and-
lo and behold, we are nearly ready.

**Correction:\
**

-   In the 5/20/2022 update, there was a miscommunication in the
    \"To-Do\" section. It was stated that some colors were inverted
    during photo capture; this was a misunderstanding that we would like
    to correct. The Camera Test Mode (available on OSKR robots and also
    valuable for development and testing purposes) was displaying some
    colors to be inverted; this is not how the camera was capturing
    them, but more so how the screen was displaying those colors. This
    issue is also now fixed.

**Regulatory Testing:**

Ahh, the smell of coffee on a Monday mor- oh, wait. That\'s not coffee,
that\'s the smell of FCC compliance! One of our final stages before full
production is ensuring that FCC compliance and other regulatory testing
is completed and all new units are marked appropriately. This regulatory
testing generally takes 30 days or less and is the final hurdle before
we hit the home stretch of production.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Update as of 5/20/2022:

The team has been working on a few more smaller bugs after making the
shipment to the contract manufacturer! Let\'s take a look.\
\
**Shipment:\
**The shipment of fixtures and calibration tools needed for
manufacturing left our office in Pittsburgh to be delivered to the
factory- when it arrived, the package was held in quarantine for a week
to be disinfected. Once this package arrived at the factory, a 5-robot
test run was completed to test the assembly line with the new fixtures
to ensure the robot calibration was successful.

**Software:**

-   *Fixes:*
    -   Software crashes during cube and charger searches are fixed!
    -   Camera Test Mode (available on OSKR robots) previously displayed
        a black screen on version 2.0. This is resolved.
    -   Some menu option names were overlaid on each other and couldn\'t
        be seen clearly in the diagnostic screens- this is now fixed.
-   *To-Do:*
    -   Some colors show inverted during photo capture; this is
        currently working to be fixed and should be one of the final
        hurdles\*\*.
        -   \*\*Please see the correction posted 6/7/2022.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Update as of 4/20/2022:

Fixed animations and sprites that were having issues on the new screen-
still analyzing logs and testing potential fixes on software crashes
during certain motions like searching for cube and charger.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Update as of 4/15:

**Shipping New Instructions/Documentation and Fixtures for Robot
Creation to Factory:**\
The team has been preparing new resources to ship to the factory for the
updated calibration and robot programming of the electronics boards that
will go in the head. This initial programming step provides the robot
with all of the base firmware that drives the motors, etc. This is a
video of the process happening in the Pittsburgh office. Here, we see a
headboard being attached to a programming fixture, then programmed with
the base recovery image that the robot will arrive with. From here, the
app will update the software during setup to give Vector his
personality. This flashing process, as well as other manufacturing
steps, have to be carefully documented, then the documentation
translated for the manufacturer\'s engineers to follow. We recently
shipped this documentation, plus more new fixtures (which are used in
this process) with updated software so that the manufacturing factory
can use them for assembly of new robots.

Once the above process is done, and we assemble all the necessary
parts\... We\'re left with a fully working and booting Vector 2.0, seen
below being tested!

**Software Adjustments for New Hardware:**

Right now, we\'re working on a few small adjustments to the software for
some issues we\'ve found in testing on the completed prototypes in the
Pittsburgh office:

1.  Some animations (like those played in Blackjack and/or for weather
    and time displays) are not displaying correctly and may need to be
    resized or adjusted for the new screen.
2.  The \"Hey Vector, go home\" command is causing a crash when Vector
    searches for his charger.

Right now we are reproducing these issues, analyzing the logs, and
updating software while we test other functions to ensure that ALL
pieces of the software work with the new hardware!

We are near the finish line to resume production and will continue to
provide updates as we can. Thank you for your patience and support.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Update as of 3/31/2022:**

<div>

**Factory in China Reopened:**\
The contract manufacturer has reopened after the most recent COVID
lockdowns in China and the factory is now back in operation. Our
engineers have had several extensive meetings with factory engineers to
bring them up to speed on current developments with calibration, along
with providing updated documentation and instructions.

</div>

<div>

**Battery Testing:\
**Optimization for the battery has been delayed by work on the camera
calibration. It was necessary to resolve the camera issues first as our
team needs the prototypes to be able to pick up cubes, recognize faces,
etc., in order to fully simulate standard usage and be able to more
accurately gauge how our optimizations are affecting the new batteries.

</div>

<div>

**Camera Hardware Changes:**\
Several customers had questions on the model of camera included with
Vector and Cozmo 2.0 that our team wanted to address. Previously, it had
been expected that we were moving to a 5MP camera for Vector. Our team
did a full investigation of the involvement this change would require,
and ultimately we made the decision to revert to the 2 MP camera. This
decision was made to avoid changes that would have been required to the
PCB (electronics headboard) of the robot, which would have caused
further delays. Thankfully, the issues that our team initially
experienced with the 2MP camera have been resolved and the results of
the 2MP camera are what you see below in this update.

</div>

<div>

**Changes to Display Cover:**\
With the new calibration and distortion reduction, we no longer have to
make changes to the display cover! See the section below for more
details.

</div>

<div>

**Camera Calibration:**\
Over the past few days, we were able to make good strides for the camera
calibration. Previously, we were focusing on cleanup passes and the
lighting in the calibration fixture to correct issues with the
calibration. With that resolved, the last major hurdle we have been
working to overcome was distortion in the camera image. Since the
calibration values are hard-coded into the robot, it is a tedious
process to modify these values between testing iterations. However,
we\'ve had a large breakthrough with the camera calibration process; we
have narrowed down issues with distortion in the camera (see photos
below) and our error rate is now within a standard range (meaning
effectively on par with Vector Gen 1, or within standard parameters
expected for the robot to consider this no longer an issue). In the
photos below depicting the distortion, you can see a significant
reduction in distortion, which allows the robot to recognize fiducials
(icons) on the cubes, as well as to provide better facial recognition
and object recognition. This may need more testing on a batch of
prototypes, but as long as results stay consistent, this breakthrough
effectively resolves the camera calibration issue and it will no longer
be a blocker to production.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Update as of 3/18/2022:

**Lockdowns in China delay work by (at minimum) 1 week:\
**A [COVID outbreak in
China](https://time.com/6157720/china-stealth-omicron-covid-outbreak/){target="_blank"}
has led to a delay of 1 week, at minimum. Strict measurements are taking
place in China to stop the spread of the Omicron variant; invariably,
this means that factories and business offices are shut down- while we
can communicate with some members of the factory staff remotely, this
slows progress and there is very little we can do to overcome that
challenge given the circumstances.

**Occlusion in vision with new camera necessitates changes to the
display cover:\
**In the update on 2/21/2022, an occlusion or blockage can be seen on
the right hand side of the image. This occlusion is caused by the
plastic display cover, which needs to be adjusted to fully utilize the
field of view of the new camera.

**Testing is ongoing for the new camera calibration:\
**The new camera picture has been cleaned up fully and we are now
re-testing and refining the new calibration results to ensure that
calibration is heavily repeatable with a low margin of error.

**Battery Testing:**\
Power and battery measurements and refinements are continuing. The team
is testing battery runtimes and charging times across multiple
conditions and activity loads for the robot.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Update as of 3/5/2022:

**Battery Testing:** Power optimization and testing is ongoing; no new
information at this time.

**Camera Calibration:** Calibration finalization is ongoing; we are
currently focusing on clarity & resolution. Additional cameras are en
route and should be received on 3/8. These additional cameras will
assist us with faster recalibration and repetition testing to ensure the
new calibration is fully stable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Update as of 2/21/2022:

We are investigating some necessary software changes for calibration of
the new camera module, and optimizing both color and resolution of the
new camera to ensure that the camera\'s feed captures colors accurately
and has face and object recognition dialed in correctly. Below, see
before and after images from when we initially got the new camera
working with the existing hardware modules, along with Pass 1, Pass 2,
and Pass 3 of improvements for clarity and color.

Let\'s move on to the current progress with the battery.   
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --

## Battery

Our team\'s calculations showed that we should get at or slightly more
than an hour of runtime on a new 600mAh battery, which is a significant
jump from the previous battery which had a runtime of about 30-40
minutes. Currently, we\'re averaging about 52-53 minutes. There are some
power optimizations we can make in multiple areas to reach our 1-hour
goal. We\'re currently doing further testing of these optimizations.
