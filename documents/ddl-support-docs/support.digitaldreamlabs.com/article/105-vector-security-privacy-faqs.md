# Vector Security & Privacy FAQs {#vector-security-privacy-faqs .title}

[](javascript:window.print() "Print this article"){.printArticle
aria-label="Print this Article"}

[This article answers questions about how Vector works, and how, and why
Vector uses certain user data.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: sections
## 1) Who is Vector?

[Vector is a home robot that moves and interacts autonomously. Vector
has personality, and his onboard processor helps him make sense of the
world. Once you set him up, he's always ready to interact, and he
connects to the cloud for his voice
features.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: sections
## 2) How does Vector find his way? Does this data go to the cloud?

[Vector navigates the world using his internal camera, accelerometer,
gyroscope, and downward-facing cliff detectors, and a process called
SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping). This processing happens on
the robot. Vector does not take or store pictures unless you ask him to
do so.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: sections
## 3) Can Vector take pictures?

[Yes. Give a command by voice for Vector to take a picture ("Hey Vector,
take a picture"). You'll hear a simulated shutter sound, and your
picture will be taken and saved to Vector's onboard memory. You can view
the picture from the Vector App, and from there, delete, share, or save
it to your phone or tablet. Your photos are not sent to or stored in the
cloud. You can delete pictures saved to Vector anytime through the
Vector app. Photos that you have Vector create are stored encrypted on
the robot. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: sections
## 4) How do Vector's voice features work?

[Vector works similarly to other voice devices. The robot processes what
he hears, and if he detects the wake words ("Hey Vector"), a stream is
opened to the cloud that includes a fraction of a second before you said
the wake words. You can also activate Vector's voice features by tapping
the button on his back. When a stream is open, Vector's lights shine
blue, and the stream is closed after you give your command. If the three
square lights on Vector's back are not on, Vector is not streaming. In
the cloud, your voice command is translated to text and processed so
Vector can understand it. You can mute Vector's mic by double-clicking
his Back button while he is off his Charger. Vector displays a "Mic
Mute" icon on his face. When the mic is muted the backpack lights are
red. For more information on what Vector's backpack lights mean, please
see

[**article**](https://support.anki.com/hc/articles/360009969334-).]{style="font-weight: 400;"}
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: sections
## 5) What happens to the voice commands I give to Vector?

[Voice command audio is deleted after processing. Text translations of
commands are saved for product improvement, not associated with a
user.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: sections
## 6) Can I turn Vector off?
:::

::: sections
[Yes, you can turn Vector off anytime from a button on Vector's back.
When you turn Vector off, he is powered off. Vector will not detect or
react to voice commands, the light on his
back]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [and camera are
off.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: sections
## 7) How do I teach Vector my name?

[When you introduce yourself to Vector, he translates the face he sees
into encoded facial features, a set of numbers not recognizable by a
person. These numbers are stored locally on the robot and are not
uploaded to Digital Dream  Labs nor shared, and you can delete this
information from Vector anytime (see below for
instructions).]{style="font-weight: 400;"}
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: sections
## 8) Can I make Vector unlearn my name?

[Yes, in two ways. Visit the Known Faces section within the Vector app,
and tap the Trash icon near the name of person you don\'t want Vector to
recognize anymore. This will delete the saved name of whomever you
choose and the numerical features paired with that name. Or, you can use
Erase Vector, which deletes all personal information stored on
Vector.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: sections
## 9) Can I delete information stored on Vector?

[Yes. You can reset your Vector and delete information stored on the
robot. You can find instructions
]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[here](//support.digitaldreamlabs.com/article/112-how-to-reset-erase-and-restore-vector){target="_blank"}[.
Please note: Erasing your data from Vector will mean you need to re-do
the initial pair and connection flow, go through the tutorial, and
you\'ll lose photos, stats, and people that Vector recognizes and knows.
Additionally, to delete your Vector app and app information, you'll need
to separately delete the Vector App from your phone or
tablet.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: sections
## 10) How does Vector handle Security?

[Vector includes a number of security best practices, including security
and privacy features like visual cues (light on his back) when the robot
is streaming data to the cloud. Customer data is encrypted between the
robot and cloud, and code running on Vector is signed and authorized by
Digital Dream Labs. Our security team extensively tests for and has
systems to detect threats and vulnerabilities on our
products.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: sections
## 11) Does Digital Dream Labs sell my data?

[No.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: sections
## 12) How do I report a security issue or a vulnerability?

[We take security reports very seriously and are committed to protect
our products, customer data and our services from security threats.
Please Contact Us at security@digitaldreamlabs.com if you suspect a
vulnerability in our systems, products, or
services.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}
