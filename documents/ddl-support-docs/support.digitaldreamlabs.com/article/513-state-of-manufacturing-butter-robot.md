# State of Manufacturing: Butter Robot {#state-of-manufacturing-butter-robot .title}

[](javascript:window.print() "Print this article"){.printArticle
aria-label="Print this Article"}

Hello! Digital Dream Labs has taken feedback from customers and
community members regarding the need for more consistent, open
communication on its current hardware manufacturing projects. Here,
we\'ll cover the current state of the **Butter Robot**.

We will strive to update these articles weekly. In some cases, there may
be no new information to post; however we\'ll communicate everything we
can, when we can. It\'s our objective to ensure that you have a thorough
understanding of your order\'s status, how we are handling production
and shipping, and clear up a few FAQs regarding Pre-Orders and shipment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Status as of 8/29/2022:

**Prototype Evaluation:**\
Prototypes were sent to the licensing partners for evaluation and
feedback; we are making a few mechanical changes to optimize the Butter
Robot after taking feedback from these partners.

**Software Development:**

-   We are making additional small modifications to the voice of the
    Butter Robot to make him more clear and understandable.
-   In the last few updates, we mentioned that the team had been working
    on an OTA system. This OTA system is now complete and will be used
    to issue software updates to the robot post-launch.

**App Development:**\
The app is continuing development; we have much of the core
functionality of the app built and we are continuing to refine the app
and add additional UI elements that will make for a more pleasant
experience.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Status as of 5/20/2022:

**Testing Prototypes:**

Multiple prototypes have been built and are currently being tested for
weight balancing and polish! Currently, weight and balancing are our
primary test focuses. Since that has been an ongoing effort (adjusting
motor software for robot stability and measuring/determining what kind
of counterweights need to go into the robot to ensure best performance),
other news is scarce. We will continue to provide more information as we
can. Until then, here\'s a short video of our efforts; we\'ve managed to
resolve many cases of the Butter Robot falling down due to his high
center of gravity, but there are a few edge cases that we are working to
resolve (for example, if the robot is leaning forward and then makes an
abrupt stop).

### Status as of 4/19/2022:

**Parts have arrived and prototype units have been assembled for
testing:**

Our team in Pittsburgh received a shipment of parts from the factory
tooling! These parts will be used to assemble several prototype robots
for various testing purposes (as we\'ll see below). Here is a bit of
what arrived at the office this week:

![](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/5e3f0b1e2c7d3a7e9ae777f5/images/625f06cb35f8b26458265d29/file-awvuUkJwm5.jpg){style="display: block; width: 399px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;"}

![](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/5e3f0b1e2c7d3a7e9ae777f5/images/625f074135f8b26458265d2e/file-iamyUC2FRv.png){style="width: 777px;"}

Once we assemble all of the above with the internal electronics, we
get\... a **prototype Butter Robot**!

**Robot Testing:**

Our new prototypes are going to be put to the test! We\'re performing
tests in all different areas to understand ways to improve the Butter
Robot and make sure that he is ready to fulfill his purpose. Here are
some testing types we\'ll be putting the prototypes through in the
coming days:

1.  Drops / shell durability
2.  Motor/gear durability
3.  Range of Motion
4.  Camera
5.  Battery life / consumption

**Battery Changes:**

Originally we expected to utilize AA batteries in the Butter Robot;
however, we believe this early decision is much improved with a new
solution. We will be switching to a new lithium-ion battery pack with
overcharge protection that will provide the ability to recharge the
robot while improving runtimes, reducing electronic waste, and allowing
more seamless usage and operation!

**Software Adjustments:**

-   Motor
    -   We are fine tuning the software for the individual motors to
        provide good range of motion, while preventing damage in the
        event that the robot is restrained somehow or if it is at full
        extension of any joints. These adjustments will prolong the life
        of the robot significantly.
-   Voice
    -   The Butter Robot has been somewhat difficult to understand- he
        talks a little bit too quickly and with very short pauses
        between words- we\'re adjusting his voice to be more clear and
        understandable without affecting his tone or personality!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Status as of 3/18/2022:

**Main focus is now to get finalized components into a full prototype
robot:**\
The PCB designs are now finished, and speakers have been selected for
use. The team is working to assemble a full prototype with the finalized
PCBs and other internal components using 3D-printed and injection-molded
parts for testing. Once completed, counterweights will be added; we are
designing and choosing materials for these counterweights. We are also
working to get a full injection-molded robot body off of the new factory
tooling; we expect this in early to mid-April.

**Choosing batteries:**\
Our team is working to select and source lithium-based rechargeable
batteries to optimize the runtime of the robot. Once we have selected
the battery type, we will work to source enough components to cover the
first manufacturing run.

**Software:**\
Work continues on the UI and features of the mobile app; we are also
researching the best options for the firmware and OTAs to be distributed
and held on the robot- the update system will likely be very similar to
Vector, but the specific logistics are still under investigation for
this hardware.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Status as of 3/5/2022:

#### Hardware:

We received a new shipment of prototype boards for the internal
electronics. The new speakers that were tested are still not up to par
with what we need from an audio standpoint; we are working to find ways
to boost amplification and/or look at further speaker alternatives that
will give us the desired feel for the robot.

#### Software:

Work continues on the mobile app\'s UI and feel. Also, last week we
focused on integrating the edge detection software and hardware
together. This is completed; next we will be testing these software &
hardware components together with some of the main boards of the robot
to test cliff detection and ensure that the Butter Robot, no matter how
pointless he believes his butter-passing mission is, will never
willingly fall off of your furniture.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Status as of 2/21/2022:

#### Tooling:

Tooling was one of the largest phases of manufacturing for the robot
that went on for several months. In our last email update we were still
working on the tooling phase. We\'re glad to say that the Butter
Robot\'s tooling is now completed and fully locked in! Tooling is also
completed for the butter tray, which will accompany the Butter Robot to
your home.

#### Hardware:

We are currently revising the internal electronics boards to better fit
parts that are available and in stock with vendors to look forward for
more manufacturing runs. One particular challenge of note was that our
previous speaker was not powerful enough- so even though it was
available and we were able to procure it, it was not loud enough when it
was placed into the robot. We are working to source and choose new
speaker components that will be:

1.  Loud enough for the user to easily hear through the body.
2.  Clear enough that speech is not garbled
3.  Small enough to fit inside the head without moving the motors and/or
    gears inside the head

We have a shipment of new speakers to test that should arrive on Friday.
We will test these and update this with our findings.

### Software:

The software for the Butter Robot is something we can really capitalize
on with the time that the hardware is taking. The \"Garbage Brain\"
application that will be the highlight of the Butter Robot\'s
intelligence is coming along well. We\'re also continuing work on the
mobile app that will drive the robot. The bones of the interface are
developed, and we\'re continuing to improve the user interface and
refine function.
