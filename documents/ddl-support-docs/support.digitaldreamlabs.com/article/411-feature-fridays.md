# Feature Fridays! {#feature-fridays .title}

aria-label="Print this Article"}

## Feature Fridays

Feature Fridays ran for approximately 6 months from April 2020 to
October 2020, and added tons of new knowledge to Vector! Each entry here
contains examples of the feature that was added, and in many cases there
are many more questions to explore for that feature- especially Small
Talk, Drink Recipes, and more! These features come at no added cost for
those with a [Vector
Membership](//support.digitaldreamlabs.com/article/344-all-about-memberships){target="_blank"}.
If you\'re new to Vector or want more ideas on how to interact with him,
see [\"Ways To Interact With
Vector\"](//support.digitaldreamlabs.com/article/122-ways-to-interact-with-vector){target="_blank"}.
