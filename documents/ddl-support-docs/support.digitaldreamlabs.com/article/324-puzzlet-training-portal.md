### [Teacher Training Portal]{style="font-weight: normal;"}

At Digital Dream Labs, we strongly believe it is important to not only
support your technology needs but also to know that our educators are
our best resource when it comes to classroom implementation. Our teacher
portal services serves to support your classroom needs. It is curated in
full collaboration with current classroom teachers. If there is anything
you'd like more information on or would like to add to this page, we'd
love to connect!\
\
*This section outlines all steps for working in the classroom with our
Puzzlets and playtrays. For information on **digital versions** of our
games, try

\
*[Puzzlet Checklist]{.underline} \
\
The following checklist has been gathered from experienced educators
using Puzzlets in their classrooms. 

#####  [Pre-Class]{.underline}

##### Find a way to organize your tiles. We\'ve heard from educators who do everything from:

1.  Writing a number on the back with a sharpie
2.  Storing them in organizational bins or ziplock bags
3.  Lay your Play trays out with a device and connect. 

##### [Post Class]{.underline}

1.  Sort the tiles back to their designated containers, since tiles will
    work with all trays you may have some students that trade and share
    with their neighbors. 
2.  Close out the app on your device, this will keep your Playtray from
    continuing to try and connect while you are not using it. 
3.  Plug your Playtray into charge over night, this isn't necessary
    everyday but is good practice. 
4.  Wipe down Play Trays with baby wipes in order to prevent any
    diseases from spreading among the students

### FAQ

\[1\]  What devices are Puzzlets Compatible with? 

Puzzlets is compatible with numerous devices, wirelessly through
Bluetooth 4.0 LE and also wired through USB 2.0.

-   iPad 3, iPad 4, iPad Air, iPad Air 2, iPad Mini, iPad Mini Retina,
    iPad Pro (wirelessly via Bluetooth 4.0 LE)
-   iPhone 4S, iPhone 5c, iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus (wireless
    via Bluetooth 4.0 LE)
-   iMac, MacBook Air, MacBook Pro (USB 2.0 only, even if your Mac
    supports Bluetooth)
-   Android tablets (wireless Bluetooth 4.0 LE, Android 4.3+)
-   Android phones (wireless Bluetooth 4.0 LE, Android 4.3+)

\[2\]  How should I manage multiple sets of Puzzlets in my class? 

When implementing new tools into a classroom, it is always very helpful
to have organizational strategies to keep everything running smoothly.
In my room, I use anywhere from 8-14 play trays at a time. To keep
things organized I simply write on the back of a tile with a sharpie
(1-14) for each set of tiles and keep them in the plastic bins that you
can pick up at a dollar store. Keeping them in bins that are large
enough to move tiles around and so your students can view what is
available to use helps to keep them from falling off of students desks
and all of the floor. 

To start working with Puzzlets, I lay the Play Trays out on student
desks with an accompanying tablet. I open up the app and as soon as I
see the blue light blink, I know my tray is connected and ready for
student use. At the end of the day, I just stack my bins up in a corner
and charge the trays from a USB port of the desktop computers in the
back of my room over night. 

\[3\]  How can I best introduce my class to programming with Puzzlets?

1.  Download the Curriculum guide! Here you will find tips, tricks and
    implementation tools.
    1.  Everything from paper cutouts to familiarize students with
        sequencing commands to assessments for students as they make
        their way through all the puzzling levels. 
    2.  We recommend starting out with Puzzlets as a full class
        activity, use the paper cuts outs, maybe act like a robot and
        get your students to program YOU to walk to the door, then
        program each other to do a task. These active, engaging
        opportunities will help students connect their ability to give
        direction to computational thinking skills that will help them
        advance through the levels of Cork the Volcano. 
    3.  Now it's time to play! Let your students engage with Puzzlets in
        pairs, or 1-1 and support their energy and excitement when
        learning to code! Walk the room, ask questions and support their
        learning. 

\[4\]  How can I filter Cork the Volcano into my classroom? 

-  No matter the subject area you teach, there's a place for computer
science in your curriculum. Cork The Volcano was built around the 4 Cs
of 21st century learning: Communication, Collaboration, Critical
Thinking and Creativity. These skills will help students develop success
in all subject matter. You can use it to support Habits of Mind,
sequencing events in reading and writing and computational thought,
patterns in math. It truly is a cross curricular  learning tool. 

\[5\] What are the Physical Aspects of the Puzzlets PlayTray?

-   Playtray - This device will wirelessly connect with your tablet via
    bluetooth. It serves as a translator between the physical and
    digital world. 
-   Puzzlet pieces - these pieces act like puzzle pieces and are what
    your students will place on the Playtray in a sequence and use to
    "program" the characters in the game to advance through levels on
    the screen. 
-   Charging Cord - This is a traditional usb lightning charging cord.
    You can plug it into a usb port on a computer to charge the Playtray
    or plug it into a compatible wall outlet mount. 

So now that you have your Playtray, Puzzlet tiles and a connectable
device you are ready to go! This interaction between the playtray and
ipad will lead to engaging 50/50 gameplay where students are enjoying
working with technology with the added benefit of tactile, hands on
learning. 

\[6\]  How do I connect my Play Tray won't connect? 

This may happen for a number of reasons. First think about your
connection. Is the ipad too close to another play tray? Maybe a student
excitedly ran up to you to show of their code but because they walked
away from their desk now the tray is disconnected. Things like this
happen, but not to worry. There's a few simple steps you can take to
make this happen less often and what to do when it does. 

1.  Close completely out of the App \-\-- so on an ipad you would double
    click and swipe up. 
2.  Bring the tablet back to the playtray, play it on top and open the
    app back up it should reconnect to the device closest and you should
    be set!
3.  If for some reason that doesn't work...turn the tablet off and turn
    bluetooth off/ back on again. 
4.  If that still doesn't work, try clicking on the reset button in the
    upper-left corner of the playtray.
5.  If issues continue, please contact us our support staff so we can
    figure out how we can help: 

\[7\] What is Bluetooth? Can even teach students!   

Simply put, bluetooth is a wireless connection device. So it enables
devices to communicate with other devices within range of it. As a
teacher all you need to do is make sure your bluetooth is turned on on
your tablet and when you open the app it will try to connect. Spend a
few minutes to go over bluetooth with your students, explain that the
playtray will connect to whatever device is closest to it.  Bluetooth
doesn't travel through water. What in the classroom is made up of mostly
water? A fish tank, maybe... but humans too! So make sure when you are
playing with puzzlets if you are working with a partner you are sitting
side by side. If you turn your back to your partner the play tray may
not be able to connect to the tablet! Also, bluetooth connects to what
is closest to it.... So if you carry your ipad across the room, what do
you think is going to happen? Once they hear about this they are much
better at being observant about what\'s going on and you will hear a lot
less "it's not working."

\[8\] How do I correct issues with USB connection?

Contact our support team about this issue, we will work with you to find
out the exact issue and send out a new cord if needed! 

\[9\] How can I best introduce my teachers to Cork the Volcano?

1.  For teachers that are averse to using technology in their classroom
    Puzzlets is a great tool to try out! Thanks to the manipulative
    tools, our play tray and tiles, keeps students engaged and
    collaborating with each other connected to the real world,  while
    also working with technology. We realize how important it is to not
    only support our early adopters but to also provide tools and
    resources for our hesitant teachers. We recommend engaging your
    teachers in a Play and Learn session where they have the opportunity
    to experience the game play in action, this will help them better
    see the vocabulary and  discussions that will develop from paired
    game play. From there offer them the resources covered in Video 3
    and provide them a link to our support videos/page where we can work
    to continue to build up and provide the support every teacher may
    need! 

\[10\] How do I get started playing?

When you click play the first screen that will appear is where your user
will select their file, Once selected you will go into the last level
played. To go back and navigate around the worlds click on the compass
in the top left corner. Now you will be on our world screen, here, as
the user passes through worlds new worlds will appear around their
island. To navigate back to other users from here click on the button in
the top right corner. To go to a world, click on the world. To go back
where you came from, click back.
