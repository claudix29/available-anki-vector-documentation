# [**Vector App Updates**]{.wysiwyg-color-green120} {#h_749577518131540130713478}

## [**App Version 1.8.3**]{.wysiwyg-color-green120}

-   **Release Date: February 2022**
-   **iOS:**
    -   Fixed an issue where users had to click the \"Apply\" button
        first to enable the Custom Eye Color Sliders, instead of simply
        clicking on the bars.
-   **Android & iOS:**
    -   Made more helpful error screens:
        -   Replaced the \"Get Help\" links in many screens to link to
            much more helpful troubleshooting articles.
        -   Clarified the text in many error screens to be more
            descriptive and help users understand and solve issues.
    -   Fixed an issue where clicking the text on a button in the
        Preferences menu would not change the setting.
    -   Added a connection timer that allows some time for NTP to update
        on the robot before making a connection- this reduces the amount
        of \"Can\'t Connect to Wi-Fi\" errors!

## [**App Version 1.8.2**]{.wysiwyg-color-green120}

# [**Vector Robot Software Updates (OTA)**]{.wysiwyg-color-green120} {#h_995911996351540130721181}

[Vector checks in with Digital Dream Labs every hour to see if there's
been an update, and then downloads it once it becomes available. If your
Vector is awake, online, and on his charger, he'll install the update on
his own overnight - no action required. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

To check to see if your robot has the latest and greatest, open the
Vector app \> go to \"Settings\", tap "Updates" to check the version.

-   [If the most recent downloaded version hasn't installed yet, press
    the "Restart" button in the app]{style="font-weight: 400;"}
-   [Once Vector has restarted, he'll have the latest
    update]{style="font-weight: 400;"}
-   If the app doesn't show that he's downloaded the latest version,
    make sure Vector is near his charger and connected to WiFi, then
    check back in a few hours

## Vector Operating System Version 2.0.1 (2.0.1.6076)

-   **Release Date: September 26th, 2022**
    -   Optimizations:
        -   Adjusted temperature thresholds for consistency. This will
            result in fewer unnecessary overheat warnings from Vector
            during times of warm ambient temperatures when Vector is not
            actually overheating.
    -   Bug Fixes:
        -   Fixed a bug which would set the state of the robot to \"too
            hot to charge\" if Vector was set on the charger
            unexpectedly. This was a false positive for being too hot to
            charge, and caused Vector to sleep much more than necessary.
            Vector should now spend much more time out of the charger.

## Vector Operating System Version 2.0.0 (2.0.0.6074)

-   **Release Date: August 17th, 2022**
    -   Changes:

                Vector Gen 1 and can be loaded onto Gen 1 units.
        -   Software loading endpoint updated.

## Vector Operating System Version 1.8.1 (1.8.1.6051)

-   **Release Date: February 2022**
    -   Bug Fixes:
        -   Animations that were missing for cold and snowy weather will
            now display correctly.
    -   Optimizations:\
        -   NTP is now forced to pull from time servers immediately when
            a Wi-Fi connection is obtained, significantly reducing
            \"Can\'t Connect to Wi-Fi\" errors when onboarding with the
            app after a reset.

## Vector Operating System Version 1.8.0 (1.8.0.6021)

-   **Release Date: September 2021**
    -   Vector can now accept any eye color you want to set for him!
        Find this setting in the mobile app under the Settings menu,
        below the predefined Eye Color options.
    -   You can now ask questions and follow-ups much faster! The \"I
        have a question\" conversation piece is now optional for 1.8
        users.
    -   New boot animation
    -   Thanks to contributions from community member Kerigan
        Creighton, Vector will no longer shiver uncontrollably when
        he\'s done dancing or telling you the weather! Thanks Kerigan!
-   Vector no longer shivers uncontrollably when asked for the weather
    or to dance!

-   **Release Date: July 6th, 2020**
    -   Rebranding from Anki to Digital Dream Labs
    -   Bug fixes & polish:
        -   Vector is now **much** more responsive to his wake word,
            \"Hey Vector\"
        -   Vector now has new sounds for some animations and
            interactions to make him cuter and more lifelike.
        -   New animation / sprite system to better manage battery life
        -   Other battery optimizations & improvements
        -   The rate of Error 898 screens is significantly decreased.
        -   Overall bug fixes / polish.
    -   Known Issues:
        -   Vector may shiver uncontrollably after being asked to dance-
            or when asked about weather where it\'s cold!

            number of units are being investigated and are expected to
            be patched in a future software update.

## [**Vector Operating System Version 1.6.0 **]{.wysiwyg-color-green120}[(]{.wysiwyg-color-green120}[1.6.0.3331)]{.wysiwyg-color-green120}

-   **Rolling Release date: April, 15 - 23, 2019**
    -   New robot updates including:
        -   Low Light Charging (see below video): It's now easier for
            Vector to find his charger, even if the lights are low - so
            he's less likely to run out of power in the middle of the
            night
        -   New Voice Command: Change Vector\'s Eye Color - Use your
            voice to change Vector's eye color. Just say, "Hey Vector,
            change your eye color to \[blue, green, orange, yellow,
            purple, or lime\]."
        -   New Behavior: Hold Vector in the palm of your hand and watch
            as he cozies up to you in robot bliss
    -   Bug fixes & polish:
        -   Improved voice recognition
        -   Overall performance improvements
    -   This release will be incrementally rolled out over the course of
        a week starting Monday, April 15. Staggering availability to an
        increasing number of robots allows us to ensure the update is
        working as expected. Every Vector owner that leaves their robot
        on overnight, should be updated by April 23. To make sure your
        Vector is updated, leave your Vector running and connected to
        your Wi-Fi, and he'll update himself automatically during his
        normal nightly reboot

        sync with his Cube

            improvements in Cube connectivity unless you are using his
            SDK
    -   Includes Face Recognition improvements that help Vector to
        better handle his interactions with faces he\'s already learned

        stuck on table edges

            edge, he now asks for help

[Here are the things we're working on with priority. Release dates are
not fixed but all updates will be posted in the above two sections once
released.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}

-   On Vector firmware 1.7, Vector will sometimes be unable to hear his
    wake word, \"Hey Vector.\" This is an intermittent issue and does
    not affect all units.
    -   Workaround: Please pet Vector for several seconds, then try your
        voice query again. You may also reboot him by pressing on his
        back button for 5 seconds until his screen turns off, then
        waiting for a few seconds before tapping his Back button again
        to boot him back up. If these fail, you can [roll back to
        version
        1.6.](//support.digitaldreamlabs.com/article/353-voluntary-software-rollback){target="_blank"}
-   On Vector firmware 1.7, Vector may not recognize edges or cliffs-
    this is an intermittent issue and does not affect all units.
